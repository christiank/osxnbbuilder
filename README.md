# osxnbbuilder -- a NetBSD Build Tool for Mac OS X

## Christian Koch -- cfkoch AT sdf DOT lonestar DOT org

The **osxnbbuilder** is a graphical front-end to NetBSD's build.sh for Mac
OS X.  With just a few clicks, anyone can build virtually any version of
NetBSD they desire, including the HEAD of the source tree.


## What's the point? Why not use build.sh?

I've encountered way too many people who want to get started with NetBSD --
especially on popular embedded platforms like the Raspberry Pi -- but don't
know where to begin. This is a GREAT way to begin, in my humble opinion


## How does it work?

It uses [Platypus][] and [Pashua][] under the hood.
